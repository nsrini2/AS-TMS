== Items

Microreview::Item.find(:api_key => "abc123")
Microreview::Item.find_by_external_type_and_external_id('Hotel', 127, :api_key => "abc123")

== Reviews

= Reading

Microreview::Review.find(:api_key => "abc123") #=> [<#Sabre::Microreview>, <#Sabre::Microreview>]

= Creating

Microreview::Review.create(:api_key => "abc123", :microreview => {:quote => "I love it", :state => true})
