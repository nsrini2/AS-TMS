<p>
	Adding videos to your community is a two step process: First, you must upload the original video file. (You've already done this...and we must say, you did a great job.) Second, is we have to encode the video to make it more "web friendly."
</p>
<p>
	This encoding process usually takes less than 15 minutes. It's important to know that until this video is encoded, it will NOT show up in the Video explore tab, so rest assured, your member's aren't experiencing the same "white blank box" that you are. ;)

	If you have any questions about this process, or think that your videos are taking too long to encode, send us an email at <%= mail_to "support@cubeless.com" %>
