<% content_for(:title, "So what's up with this karma number?") -%>
<p>It's a simple number to represent your activity within the community. By doing good things like asking great questions,
answering others' questions, and visiting the site regularly, your Karma will increase. And, as an added bonus, your
top-notch questions and answers that others vote as positive or as the "Best Answer" will also boost your community Karma.</p>
      <p>As your Karma increases you'll gain the ability to add additional photos to your profile and receive special recognition and status in the community.</p>
<p>FYI - What goes around comes around... shady activities can also lower your Karma.</p>
<p>Here are the details (for all the bean counters out there):</p>
