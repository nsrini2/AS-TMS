<h2>Welcome to the Site Configuration tool known as iConfig</h2>

<strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">Please realize, when you save something, it goes live to the site. There is NO 'undo' and there are NO 'backups'.</strong>
<br/>
<i style="font-size: 0.9em;">(OK there are backups but they are hard to get to so don't make us go find them.)</i>

<br/><br/>

<p>
	This tool will allow to edit most of the configurations associated with this community, however there are a few exceptions.<br/>You CANNOT edit:
	<ul>
		<li>the email server settings (smtp)</li>
		<li>the session settings (key and secret)</li>		
		<li>any single sign on settings</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	
	Other than that...have fun. :)
